0 11 I wonder if Sean will address this. Or maybe his mind is being blown by the amount of people he disappointed.
3 59 Who fucked up worse Pokemon Go or No Mans Sky?
4 22 Probably the one that's charging $60 instead of $0.
4 56 Nah. He'll probably go on some smug rant about how we're "entitled" or have "unreasonable expectations" or possibly that we don't understand his "art".   
4 49 If I were him, I'd get my money, put it on my yacht, and flee the country.
3 59 Or maybe he is blowing his mind with all the money he got.
4 13 My names Sean. Ill address it.  The game sucks. 
4 8 Why is this marked as Satire/Joke its literally true.
4 0 "I can't believe so many people are here! WOW!"
4 13 Have HG not actually addressed anything since the release? No statements, no Q/A, nothing? 
4 55 They posted some workaround fixes for the pc version on their website but they didn't talk about things like sales, review etc...
2 47 What's this reference from? I keep seeing it but I can never find clips on youtube of it. 
3 2 its from his twitter.  he said multiple times that yes you can see each other and yes you can even play together, but when 2 people asked about why they couldn't see each other he went on and said that its amazing that discoveries are even happening still, that they are so many of you playing that its testament to the network engineers that the database servers are still even running.  meanwhile, the fact that you can straight up pause the entire universe, no network packets going out, and due to the fact that its been tested out 10+ times already, people infact cant see eachother, you cant interact at all, and sean murray has just been straight up lying about it the entire time, or it was a planned feature that he hoped no one would notice it missing until they had time to implement it, but still didn't even say that.  he keeps using this twisted wording and it has royally pissed people off.
3 27 > no network packets going out, and due to the fact that its been tested out 10+ times already, people infact cant see eachother, you cant interact at all, and sean murray has just been straight up lying about it the entire time, or it was a planned feature that he hoped no one would notice it missing until they had time to implement it, but still didn't even say that.  Hell there is already a crack out that lets you play 100% offline, you can even upload discoveries to the server without network access and get the credit rewards...   
4 10 too bad the discoveries just get deleted
3 52 The game was released DRM free, I don't think it never needed a crack
3 5 Oh okay. Yeah I've seen the interviews, he's horribly awkward and I you can see him lying through his teeth. I thought this was an interview where he said that and I was DYING to see the confrontation.   I bought No Man's Sky a week and a half ago because I didn't realize how bare of a game it actually was. Wish I could get a refund from the PS4 store. 
4 53 You can get a refund if you've never requested one before. I refunded NMS and got my money back almost instantly.  I'm on mobile so I can't link but just Google Sony customer service chat and you'll find it.
1 24 He knows better than anyone. 
2 48 > Or maybe his mind is being blown by the amount of people he lied to.  FTFY
1 41 A quintillion amount of disappointment   Procedurally generated complaints 
2 48 Yet the same complaint can appear several times in a single negative review.
2 5 It's possible, but very very unlikely that he cares. There is just too mich disappointment for one person.
0 39 WOW! there areso many of you all! AMAZING!!!
4 53 Thanks for buying the game!
4 33 #Mind Blown!
3 53 MIND BLOWN!
3 19 So many refunds!! WOW, a testament to how bad of a job our net coders did!!
4 1 Blame Sean, not the coders. Sean is the one who promised all of these things and lied to the public, not the coders. 
4 13 Woooosh!
4 20 I understood the home completely, but people will (and have) blame the coders for not delivering on what was promised to them 
3 17 I'm dying xD savage af!  
4 25 Back to facebook with you.
3 32 Do you need a hand with that?
4 32 He needs a big ~~back~~ bag/sack of money.
4 36 A big bag? A big sack?
4 38 like a bank bag, make the illusion he just robbed a bank. 
4 41 It was a joke because you said "back", which could've been a misspelling of bag or sack.
3 56 Where do people find these exploitable comics in the first place?
3 50 When did he say this?  Does anyone have a link to it
4 3 earlier, and yes
4 19 I saw a version where the last panel said "we are just a 12 man team". 
3 17 why is he barefoot?
3 39 I thought the right question was: why is he defenestrating himself?
3 32 he had to sell them to get money for the refunds /s
3 34 THEY'RE JUST A TEAM OF 15 GODDAMN IT! CUT THEM SOME SLACK! /s
3 35 He was about to go get some shoes, but the refunds took away all the money he planned to use on them. 
3 35 He's just like his game, bare
4 47 Did you just direct link to 4chan  Let me clarify. Did you just direct link an image from 4chan
4 55 lmao I didn't feel like uploading it to imgur
3 31 It's a die hard situation
3 56 underrated comment
3 54 yippee ki yay mother fucker!
3 31 He hasn't repaired his shoe module. That'll be 200 carbon.  Edit: forgot a word. 
3 39 Shoes recharged
4 53 Shoe support low: 99% charged
4 0 New milestone   shoes repaired 50 times
4 42 *2 huge black bars obstruct the screen*
4 7 Life support 25%.
4 19 nonononono  it's:  Life support low: 75% (even though it's not low in the slightest)
4 37 Everyone I know who has played this game including me thought that's what it says. If you listed super carefully, the suit actually says "lowering" instead of "low" lol. 
2 18 But.. he is the good guy!
4 42 Spoole?
4 37 Heheheheh
3 29 le memento meme 
3 31 This is great, does anyone have a Molyneux version of this?
4 15 Someone should x-post that to /r/offensive_wallpapers
4 54 I was meaning basically the exact same image as the one you posted originally but with Molyneux rather than Sean, but the more the merrier as far as these kinds of pictures are concerned.
4 56 Ah, I see. I saw only Todd Howard as the other version.
1 11 I just realised that the refund system was a genius idea from Valve. A lot of people just refund back to the steam wallet and they will spent the money pretty fast on something else again.  Refunding a 60 game to everyone would kill most games but Valve doesnt really need to care because they will get most of the money back and they get some good PR
1 16 Valve keeps their cut even if you refund. So if you buy a game for $100 the dev gets $70 and valve gets $30, but if you then refund the dev has to refund you $100 and valve keep their $30.
1 20 How do you know this?
1 30 Conversation with a dev when the refund system was introduced, can't remember the exact share that Valve takes so I went with 30% for the example.
1 48 [citation needed]
3 18 Not sure about Steam personally, but having worked in the industry I can say it's not impossible. Apple is famous for doing this.
1 54 Developers on Steam can't post the percentage Steam receives. It's a breach of the contract to be a Steam developer.
2 5 I'm talking about the cut that Valve allegedly makes according to /u/spazturtle. And I know they can't talk about it, which is why I don't believe a random user claiming things with the only source to back that up being "a developer I have spoken to this one time".
2 7 I said that I used 30% as an example as I don't know the cut. The cut that valve receives doesn't affect my post in any way as my post was talking about refunds.
4 38 I could have refunded to my credit card but you're right, I decided to refund it to my Steam wallet.  I'd love to spend that $ on a better game since that's what it was intended for anyway.
4 17 Meanwhile, Kerbal Space Program is -50% off on Steam until Monday. Is this coincidental timing or a clever marketing strategy?
4 44 I'm guessing just a coincidence, or a combination of both, because KSP goes on sale pretty frequently (although it's usually just -25%). Maybe they noticed the NMS shitstorm and since they were going to do a sale regardless, they decided to make it -50% instead of -25% in hopes of attracting some of the people who were disappointed with NMS.
4 14 on top of that while it gives them good PR  Valve still keeps the 30% cut from the profits, which believe means Valve demands the game devs to fork over -in this case- 20 to the customer directly.  Valve gets good PR, (credits you with Valve bucks I believe, which results with another garentee purchase from steam), valve keeps the 30% cut.  win-win
4 3 ive only used it once, on rainbow six seige, dont get me wrong its a great game, i love watching pros play it, but not for me. Refunding it was so easy, and quick
3 57 Most stores give store credit upon refunds. It's not some fancy new strategy.
3 54 You have no idea how right you are.  I refunded NMS and got the Witcher 3 with all the DLC (~$75) and also bought Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen  because it was on sale for $17.  I wouldn't have gotten either game if not for the fact that I refunded NMS to my steam wallet.  Tl;dr: refunded NMS and spent more the second time around.  GG valve.
3 53 whats the refund policy on steam? 7 days return?
4 5 14 days and a max of 2 hours playtime. They are really kind with this restriction (already refunded games after 4 weeks with almost no playtime) 
3 52 But you only get to use it like 3 times right? Pretty sure I saw that when I returned Dark Souls (PC port of the first game is pretty shit).
3 53 You can refund as often as you want. I refunded like 7 games already. If you refund too many games too fast and it looks like you want to abuse the system you get a warning. If you keep refunding you will lose the ability to refund.
3 34 It was not a "genius" idea by Valve. They were late to the game (Origin did it about three years earlier) and had to be dragged kicking and screaming by EU and Australian courts.
3 16 Also, you realize that Valve keeps its cut every time, right?  For example, buy No Man's Sky for $60, Valve takes their cut from the developer, get a refund to Steam Wallet, you the user gets $60 back, Hello Games has to refund fully.   Buy another game?  Valve takes their cut from the next developer.......
3 4 It's not just that they'll get it back. They already have your money, even if it's just sitting in your wallet. So what you use it on is of no concern to them.
3 31 You dont have to refund back to your steam wallet, you can refund it back to your payment methode aswell
2 56 You could buy gift codes and sell them off to resellers. If you wait for some good sales, you might even turn in a profit!
2 45 I always refund to paypal. When i refund to steam wallet steam puts a hold on the money for like 24 hours. You are right tho i always end up spending it on Steam again. 
1 50 Refund system is required by EU law, and same law requires Steam to refund you in same way you used to pay.  Ony two exceptions are if refund is not technically possible (Bitcoin or pre-paid coupons) and if you agree on using another way.
1 55 >Ony two exceptions are if refund is not technically possible (Bitcoin or pre-paid coupons) and if you agree on using another way.  Wrong. Custom made stuff is an exception too because they cant sell your custom made couch for example to anyone else.  Either way pretty much no one else (except gog I think) offers refunds (Origin, uplay and stuff like that) and they are even making more money with refunds.
2 18 I meant exceptions in relation to payment, I'm aware that there  is shitload of other exceptions as well :)  Origin, Uplay & co is either not EU-based, or they are just betting on that noone is going to sue them. Or they will do refund if asked, but keeping quiet about that to not encourage customers.
2 33 They sell stuff in the EU, they target EU people and they accept payments from the EU. That means they have to follow EU law... just like Steam until a while ago they wait until someone sues them and forces them to have a real refund system.
2 57 Yeah, but Steam has offices in EU and GOG is located in Poland, so they are directly affected.  I'm not sure how it works when EU customer is buying from US company with no connections to EU, but I don't think EU law should apply to US company in such case.
3 23 Too bad you're wrong then.  The way it works is, if you want to sell to specific market, then you've got to abide by that market rules. In this case, Steam, Origin, Uplay, etc wanted to operate in the EU market, they've got to abide by the EU rules. This is the connection you're talking about.
3 38 Nope, that's not how it works. You don't "want to sell to specific market" just by opening store on the Internet.  Anyway, I've checked UPlay and Origin.  > 5.7	Cooling Off Period. If you reside in the European Union, You have the right to withdraw from a contract within fourteen calendar days without giving any reason (Cooling Off Period), commencing on the day after the date of the conclusion of such contract.  UDon'tPlay  > D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of Service and your Account(s);  Origin.  -  I learned that Ubisoft is actually a French company, so it makes sense. EA probably has EU offices in England, just as Valve does. That will be, by the way, pretty funny after brexit :)
4 2 Yes, that's how it works.  EU customers who buy physical goods outside the EU market normally pays importation tax. This tax is designed to disincentivise average customers from buying goods outside the EU market. The reason why this happens is because EU market has certain standards (e.g. safety) as to how goods must be upheld to and how companies can be held accountable to this standard, and there's some of protectionism into it but this is the same for all the markets. Obviously, there is no suitable replacement for importation tax in relation to digital goods, although most of, if not all digital goods on Steam, Origin, etc are still in line with standards of the EU market.   As always, law system is slow to adapt but in 2014, EU law in relation to refunds for digital goods was implemented and it took about a year for Valve to implement this into Steam.  Do you know why? Because they have to or they'd get sued.  Laws surrounding each markets absolutely do apply regardless of whether one has physical residence in locations where laws are originated. All it matters is whether one wants to do business with any of those markets. Don't want to do refunds? Don't sell in the EU, end of.  Valve was never obligated to do refunds for the US customers but they did it anyway because the fallout it would cause had the US customers known that the EU customers were able to get refunds would be unreal.
2 7 > Refund system is required by EU law  Hah, Switzerland and UK don't care about that! Take this, evil government! We have the **FREEDOM** to be fucked by companies! Hah!
4 51 > but sadly digital media are an exception as soon as you started streaming/downloading them.  This probably differs from country to country even in EU, mine country, for example, has no such exception.  Also, I'm not sure how it works for Origin and UDon'tPlay, but Steam doesn't sell digital downloads. It sells "subscriptions". Temporal and revocable subscriptions.
2 22 It is more that the cost is put mostly on the dev and Valve is big enough to soak any costs they occur.  Valve's refunds are one of the best things in the game industry in a long time.  Unlike EA's refunds you can refund anyone's game.  This is a big way for consumers to pressure developers.  The whole release it and fuck the customers methodology doesn't work anymore.  We first saw this with Batman: Arkham Knight.  They pulled the game from sale they will getting hammered so hard.  Compare it to Assassin's Creed: Unity (the game that probably inspired Steam's refund policy.)  Ubisoft barely addressed the complaints and offered some shitty DLC for a shitty game as compensation.  With refunds, PC devs now have to worry about the post release.  No more cut and run.  Plus as a consumer you are now more confident when you spend money with Valve and happier with your purchases.  That's good for Valve in the long term.  Valve actually thinks about the long term in comparison to other game companies.
4 55 Valve won't lose anything. They will get every cent back from the publisher. They swing so much dick in the industry that their agreement almost certainly places full liability for poor game performance on there publishers. Besides most refunds are likely to just get spent on another game anyways.
4 28 Steam refunds weren't inspired by a game, but by a court ruling in Australia (I think), that said they had to offer refunds to consumers by law. Thus followed a company wide policy. Have no illusion, Valve would probably not be doing refunds without this precedent.
4 32 If it was solely the court ruling, refunds would not be offered in the US.
4 0 >the game that probably inspired Steam's refund policy.  Unless I'm remembering the timeline wrong, what inspired their refund policy was being dragged through EU courts for not having the option to refund.
2 6 If you refound NMS you could but 5 good games. Just think about that
2 52 I'd get 3 vive games. Or maybe raw data and one more.
4 4 Im gonna but the shit out of my refund! 
2 39 Why would you want to have found NMS a 2nd time
3 37 Underrated comment
3 23 Because you could but 5 good games. Just think about that
3 33 But 5 good games! Just think about that
3 55 Amazing!
4 4 That's so many games you could be playing. Amazing.
4 34 5! 5 games! That's a lot of games!
3 47 Am i whitnessing the birth of a new meme?   **heavy breathing intensifies**
4 26 Just think about that. 
1 22 Yes, true, except it's not true. They refund you via the payment system you used. If you used paypal, or CC, they'll refund you that way.
4 31 They still get an interest free loan if you do that though.
4 50 Why do people keep saying this?  It's not an interest free loan.  I gave them money, and they gave me a game.  I then played that game.  I got value from the money they took.  If I then get the money back, I don't lose the value from playing the game.  It's really them giving me something for free, not the other way around.
4 53 Because they still made money from the money you gave them.  People aren't saying it as a "lol u idiot u gaev them free money", but they're saying it in a "even though they gave you a refund they still made money of it"
3 38 It took a whole week to see the refund on my CC for NMS. I wish they'd speed up the process a little.
2 59 It gives you a choice. I refunded a game today and it's a drop down menu, with steam credit selected by default, and I initially paid via paypal.
2 40 Last time I used the system I could choose between card and wallet. If you bought more than one thing at a time and want to refund just one of the items you *have* to get a refund to the wallet or refund everything you bought with it for money back.
1 36 You can actually do a refund to your steam wallet if you use Credit
1 37 Yes if you specifically ask for it. But that'd be stupid unless you plan to buy something on steam immediately, there's no point doing that.
4 6 Idk, anecdotal and all that, but most of my PC gamer friends are buying stuff on steam fairly regularly so it wouldn't be a problem for any of us.  I know I am good for about 20 bucks a month unless there's a AAA release I just *have* to have right away, which hasn't been for like 5 years now. /r/patientgamers unite! 
3 5 why would it be stupid? i reguerally spend money on steam about every month, and it was valve that saved me 60$ from a wasted game.  they should be rewarded for taking the risk. also the wallet method is usually much quicker and returning money from steam bank account into my bank account usually takes a lot longer (guessing 2 weeks?) while also they are more resistant to doing that. if its in the steam wallet they technically didn't lose the money.
4 24 Alternately, sometimes they just refund it to your stream wallet regardless of what you requested, and refuse to move it.   It's steam support. They're better, not good.
2 25 It boils down to how fast you want your money back.  You can see the money in your Steam wallet in like a day.  I only refunded once so far and sent it straight to my Steam wallet.  Bought a game on winter sale, it didn't work, refunded it, bought a different game on winter sale instead.  Truthfully, most people on PC master race spend enough money on Steam that they will spend their steam wallet.
3 43 You did what BlindSp0t just said. Refunding to your wallet only makes sense if you plan to spend it on steam again soon.  If not, now your money is locked to steam and while it sounds like an odd thing to say here some do not purchase games directly via Steam all the time.  I would argue against refunding to the steam wallet (if possible). Even if there is a game you would want to buy you hopefully have enough funds in your bank account that used through paypal / CC to pay the game even if the refund hasn't arrived in your account yet. If you don't have enough money, maybe you should think twice before buying.  unless you first have to transfer funds to your paypal, that makes the equation a bit more complicated.
2 33 Yes, but still, as long as you're not in a limited time window (as in steam sales like you said) it's always preferable to get real money instead of a value in Steam's database. You could need the money for something else, while still being able to spend it on steam if you want.
3 18 >You can see the money in your Steam wallet in like a day.  It takes a business day to get money back into your Steam wallet? Doesn't sound very fast.  Anyways, for a credit card the amount of time it takes to get your money back really doesn't matter, since it's on a line of credit and any games you buy won't post until the refund is posted.
2 34 Steam Wallet has taken up to 24 hours for me while PayPal is instant. Can differ depending on your bank of course.
4 37 PayPal took 3 days when I refunded NMS, and Steam Wallet took 3 milliseconds when I refunded Life Is Strange. Must be case by case. 
1 17 That's true, since you get a steam wallet refund valve just earn more money from sale cuts
3 15 That benefits everyone, or at least 2 out of 3 in the scenario. 
3 30 Presumably when you refund, both Valve and the game publisher return their shares of money, no? It would be weird if Valve demanded that the publisher refunded more than they actually received from the sale. So Valve doesn't get extra cash that way.
4 31 I've read that developers only get paid quarterly from Steam, so presumably they just take the refund from that pile of money before it even enters the hands of the developers.
4 26 I believe there was something about this when the refund system was first introduced.  Valve keep their cut, take it back from the developer, so the developer actually loses out a bit. Can anyone confirm?
4 45 Can't confirm at the moment, but that seems very unlikely.
4 13 To save on the number of transactions I don't think Valve pays the developer as soon as the game is brought.  I expect that Valve will total up a number of sales for a set time period (week / month) then transfer a lump sum. Cuts down on overheads.   Refunds would be deducted from the next outgoing payment.  x sales - y refunds = z actual payment
3 35 Sure, but then Valve's cut goes back into your Steam wallet so you can spend it on another game, and then they get their money back.
3 54 So they aren't earning *additional* income, only making sure they keep that initial sale cut, yeah?
4 9 Yes.  Unless you buy one of their games I guess.
3 59 That's the idea. Why do you think retail stores take ANYTHING back in almost any condition if you accept store credit ? Keeps the $$ in their system
4 2 Yeah I know that but /u/anonymouspls said they **do** earn additional income  > That's true, since you get a steam wallet refund valve just earn more money from sale cuts  I was just confirming he was incorrect
3 52 Actually the money has been valves the moment you added it to your wallet. They don't get their money back. It's just that they were already paid when you added it. 
4 11 My point was if you were to get a refund directly back to Paypal or your credit card, Valve gets nothing.
4 18 They got an interest free loan
4 16 Except if you used a credit card Steam offers an option to return the money to the card , it takes a few extra business days but you can get your money back
4 17 That just means you gave valve an interest free loan. 
4 48 It's not a loan if I'm using the value of the money for something.  It's more like Valve gave me a loan.  I gave them money, they gave me a game that I played.  I return the game, I get the money back, but I don't lose the entertainment from playing the game.
4 24 If you refund it in the same billing cycle I dont how that will be an issue
1 19 Can confirm, my refund just got accepted despite being declined before and having 12 hours of playtime.  Praise steam.  Edit: Before you start lynching me, go buy this turd of a game yourself and see how bad it is; I challenge you not to refund it. I'll be buying elite dangerous now, I recommend the rest of you who wanted a space game like this to do the same. :)
3 42 Wtf. How he hell did you play TWELVE hours to decide you didn't like it?
4 38 Maybe he's like me and leaves games running sometimes when he gets up to do stuff (make dinner, do laundry, etc.)
4 42 Then that's just a terrible way to exist. That's the same as forgetting to go back to the store for the broken tool for a month so the refund period expired. Not their fault. It was your negligence. 
4 36 Because NMS is a game where even getting out of the starter system can easily take you two hours. What you see in the starter system does not represent the entire game because it's random - you might get a nice starter system, or you might not, and there's no way for you to tell which one it is. The only thing you can do in two hours is figure out whether the game works at all (or doesn't), and refund if it doesn't. Many of the other big flaws only really start becoming obvious much later when you've explored many more systems.  You don't review a game by playing it for 10 minutes and drawing conclusions based on that. Similarly, you can't know whether a game is what the developers promised if you've only played it for 10 minutes because you've barely scratched the surface. No Man's Sky's problems lie much deeper and 2 hours simply isn't enough for you to get an idea of what the game *really* is like.
3 55 Maybe he didn't like it in the first 5 minutes, but kept playing in hopes of it getting better. 
4 0 Then he shouldn't get a refund. It's absurd. I get a meal and eat it all, I don't get a refund. I don't get a refund because six months after I buy a refrigerator I ask for a refund. That's not how it works. There is a term to that for a very good reason. It allows game dev companies to have a confidence level in their incoming financials.   Steam has a policy for customer satisfaction and to be fair enough to game devs for them to list on the store. This shift will give those companies second thoughts.  Strict enforcement of the polcy means people invest (private investors for example) in making video games. It will scare some of them.   The previously policy was more than fair. 
4 34 I wasn't talking about the refund policy. I was just saying that it doesn't have to take 12 hours for someone to figure out they don't like a game. 
4 53 No it teaches game developers not to lie and make false promises about what the game will have in order to make more money which is a very good thing.   Also your food and refrigerator analogies are terrible. This is more like being sold a car that supposedly has the power and handling of a super car but it actually turns is just a regular car. Yes it works but it's not what you were promised so of course you should be able to get your money back. 
4 45 It's absurd of the unfinished product these dipshits thought they could release and get away with it. But if you buy a dinner plate and the waiter says it gonna be one thing and ends up being something different but you're still hungry so you say fuck it and eat it anyways and half way through you realize you're eating a pile of shit.   And in response to your comment about game devs. They brought this upon themselves by releasing a fucking game that's not even finished so they deserve this shit for trying to pull shit 
4 48 The game devs statement applies though to the whole industry now. Steam changing policy means that the industry is even riskier. Less interesting games come from these decisions. 
4 44 Sorry this is so long:  I have heard a lot of people played the game for 10 hours thinking that the lack of features was just because it was early in the game. They keep playing hoping the game will deliver on what they are promised and it never happens. It sucks, but the fact that you can't return a game that doesn't do what you are promised it does is kind of bullshit.   This is an extreme case and those who gave this company their money deserve to have it returned to them.   Imagine you saw that a car company was releasing a special new car with all of these amazing features, you are able to reserve your car by paying a percentage of the car's price. You get the car and it LOOKS like the car you were promised so you pay the man and take it home. On the way home you notice that certain features don't work the way you thought they would, so you drive the rest of the way home and tell yourself you will check out the manual when you get home.   You get home and open the manual and it's a single leaflet that is basically "Thanks for buying your very own No Man's Car!"  You sit in the car for a while and can't get the sound system to sound right, or at all. The horn only works sometimes and the heating and cooling system is a clunky mess and is hard to figure out. You check the internet and everyone else who bought the same car is having the same kinds of problems.   You decide to bring it back to the dealership, which is pretty far away from your house. So you drive there and when you get there you say "This has none of the things you said it would." and they laugh at you and say "We only allow people to return cars with less than 1 mile on them. Sorry for your luck. Thanks for the money."  Fuck that dealership, they are shit bags. Now imagine the entire industry was like that. And constantly pushed the envelope on how much you can promise vs what they need to deliver on.   The people who made No Man's Sky promised that amazing super car, and delivered a base model Honda Civic. Those who gave it a chance and decided that they had had enough deserve to get their money back.
4 47 Your analogy makes good sense. For some stated features, I agree you are right. Unfortunately I think this is more like people complaining about he concept car not matching what is sold in the lot. The concept cars never match up.   I am clearly in the minority. That's fine though. 
4 50 It's more like people saw the concept car, were told they could buy it before it was done being produced and they would get it when the car was released, but then weren't allowed to see the finished product until they picked it up and paid for it, took it home and tried it first.
4 43 You lost me on the refrigerator analogy.
4 38 Ok, Sean
4 55 My real name is Mean Surray. I am from... The Disunited Kingdom. It's still a part of the EU!
4 43 Afraid not. Good try
4 24 I honestly didn't expect it to go through, but I can tell you that the gameplay was dull as all fuck. Let my friends have a go too and they agreed, playtime from myself would probably be around 4 hours ish.  (never actually finished the game, and if we're using the meal analogy, let's say I just had the starting beer, which was shit quality)
4 36 You still owe for the beer unfortunately you came to the Golden Coral. You paid at the door.   Regardless, I respect your opinion on the game. I strongly disagree with the ethics of asking for a refund that much later.   It's wrong.   Also I played the game. I like it. I get why people don't like it. 
4 38 It's not wrong. If a company's policy is you're allowed a refund no questions asked, at any time, it is not morally wrong to utilize that option. They offered it.   If a bar says "if you drink this entire beer and don't like it, we'll give you a refund" and you do just that, it's not immoral. 
4 45 The developers agree to the policy that their game can be refunded when putting it on Steam. They therefore agreed that if somebody wants a refund they can receive one no questions asked. Therefore I see no way this is morally wrong.
4 33 I'd say this game is different than the normal case in that it basically artificially extends playtime. To do anything at all takes more than 2 hours.
4 55 > I'll be buying elite dangerous now  There is some serious issue with elite dangerous, however, its fun for the first 40-60 hours, and maybe even longer for you. Its worth the cost, but its a grind fest make no mistake about that.    
4 55 Don't buy Elite Dangerous. You are exchanging a turd for a turd.
4 56 then I shall refund another turd! 
4 55 I'm in the same boat, the game just isn't fun after a couple of hours, the first bit is pretty cool exploring and shit but there is no goal after that it is just... empty. Maybe I'll buy it again if they release some MASSIVE updates for it.
4 51 By Elite Dangerous I hope you mean Star Citizen :D
4 52 sadly it was refunded to my steam account since the funds were from a birthday steam card, and i don't believe SS is on steam. (yet)  :(
4 53 Ahh very true didn't even think of that. Ah well anything is better than NMS :D
4 34 Did you have it refunded to paypal or steam?
4 36 Steam.
4 56 Thanks for the quick response
4 9 Did you just submit a second request or follow up on the declined one? I was rejected for having 11 hours played.
4 5 I sent 2 and both got declined I have 15 hours playtime, I am so depressed :( What did you write in the text box and what option did you choose for refund? "Game was something else than I expected" or "performance issues" ? appreciate the help my friend
3 51 I tried a week ago and it got rejected because I had 15 hours. Is this a new thing? 
4 53 Let me know if it works for you. I am at the same play time!
1 20 What options did you pick and did you write any notes?
4 30 I found the refund people to be very understanding. I refunded Final Fantasy type 0, even though I had like 6 hours of gameplay, but I explained that of those 6 hours the first 2 are just a massive intro cutscene/tutorial, and the rest was me struggling with the worst keyboard control scheme ever made for a videogame, which just made the game unplayable for me. And I got refunded within 12 hours no questions asked.
1 24 I put issue not listed and made a note about how it runs awful on my PC and the fact that it didn't deliver what was promised at all.
4 16 I put not listed as well then wrote "All of the above", got refunded. 
3 47 I tried this and was just declined because of playtime
4 33 Same here.
1 50 And it was an immediate refund? No conversation with steam support before pushing it through?
4 3 This happened to me for few times too (for other games ofc.). I don't think 2 hours limit is actually required...
2 7 Nope, refund was issued in around an hour with no questions asked.
3 44 as it should be.  the dev straight up lied about game content like wtf.  
2 42 I tried around 6 hours ago and was told it wouldnt be refunded because I had more than 2 hours of playtime. Try again I guess?
3 37 Maybe they have an upper limit on how many hours can be played 
3 58 I only have about 16 hours. So around the upper limit of where people are claiming they got a refund.
3 59 Keep pestering them. Never give up, never surrender.
3 41 Eh, but the image that OP posted said regardless of playtime. And 2 hrs use to be the maximum limit, to which they changed because of all the rage 
0 1 Really? I tried a refund for 12 hours of playtime and they declined. Maybe i'll try again. :p  Edit: Refund accepted. :D
3 46 Under what category did you put it under when you were requesting it? "I purchased this by accident" or?
0 46 Try being specific in the comments about why you want to return it. Maybe just "it's not fun" doesn't count. Try saying that it won't run or some other error it is having. 
2 5 Yep, he played for 12 hours but the game won't run.
4 6 Pretty disgusting seeing all the people defending their 12-24 hour playtime refunds in here. 
4 5 Chill. I had 2 hours of Splinter Cell: Blacklist and did not get a refund. The 2 hours? Trying to get multiplayer to work with my friend whom i bought it specifically because of. It was in total per attempt between 6 to 8 minutes with cut scenes and loading times. Alt tabbing to look on google for help. All in all i never got multiplayer to work more than twice. But the time it took to debug and trouble shoot was just over 2 hours.
3 48 You tell them that the game was false advertising and it takes more than two hours of gameplay. Or just keep bitching because eventually they'll refund it anyway :/
2 55 He just had to make sure after the 11th hour of testing that the game in fact won't run. Wouldn't want to ask for a refund without being absolutely sure.
3 3 To be fair, I have a game in my library I have never played but have almost 100 hours in because it was "running" without the program ever running.
3 44 I had the VR game virtual desktop do this. Managed to rack up like 12 hours of playtime while I didn't even have the vive plugged in. 
3 17 Same for me, it was Dark Souls PtD edition. Have 74 hours on it and never even got it to open
3 45 Mine was operation flashpoint but still it makes for a good conversation when people bring comments like that one up
0 4 Yeah you have to pester them a little :p
0 2 This is why bitching help's - this to all the people who said complaining did nothing.   Poor ps4 user's lol. but Source? i don't know if this is true. 
4 2 Plurals are spelled with additional "s" (mostly, some have other methods). Apostrophe means that there are one or more letters omitted.   John has been... - John's been..  That is awesome - that's awesome  Bitching does help, so bitching helps.   These are wild dogs. These are a wild dog's tracks.   Poor PS4 user's lol. Of only he treated his lol better, it wouldn't have been so poor.   Poor PS users, lol, they can't get a refund.   Hopefully you learn now. Have a nice day!    
1 49 If you're annoying enough Sony can refund a game 
4 32 Just for future reference; you're not supposed to put an apostrophe before an "s" when something is not possessive.
3 36 I did nothing because I didn't buy it.
1 23 Why do you call basic consumer complaints bitching?
3 58 People who say speaking out against bad games does nothing are dogs drinking tea in a burning house claiming everything is fine. Every time they have been proven wrong. Paid skyrim dlc. Gone. Arkham knight broken. Gone. No refunds for a game that is vast but shallow. Gone. 
2 16 It's fake. I was just denied again after seeing this post. Playtime is less than 5 hours.
2 58 Try again, that's what people have been doing. Games that are outside the 2 hour 2 week zone are manually reviewed. You might've been reviewed by a rep having a shitty day.

0 49 Ah thanks. Do you reckon it's against the rules to just post the thread id? Or does that count as trying to circumvent the rules? Someone call a mod!
4 13 If it's on Reddit then it's not allowed. The subreddit has gotten banned for it before
4 38 Yea, it's a reddit thread. Why is this rule a thing and so harshly enforced? I don't understand :|
0 32 Done

2 15 same here please.
3 35 PSN CSR denied my refund request earlier this week because they don't take ownership of what game developers promise vs deliver. Mined a mountain of gold for over an hour last night. Game crashes. Restarts before I landed on the planet. Back to PSN support chat, explained how unacceptable all the game crashes were. CSR "I totally get it. Mine crashed last night after 30 minutes of mining emeril. I'll get your refund started."
0 50 *helps  *users  but good point nonetheless
1 35 OH SHIT, HERE COMES AN "S"
3 58 better use one of them 'postrophe's 
0 30 Help's what?
2 22 Oh shit here comes an 's'. 
2 38 Here's a rule to help you remember when to use an apostrophe to signal the plural form on an English word:  Never.  It rhymes with ever, ever, and ever. 
0 23 Also waiting on source. Nothing currently on the steam page for me. Really hoping OP doesn't take our sweet karma and run

1 39 RIP OP with all these PM requests
4 7 OP plz
0 19 Ha, they still didn't update their preview screenshots and trailer vid. 
4 49 Yep, highly misleading.
4 25 What do you mean?  Are there shots of things that aren't in the game?
4 49 Almost all the things you see are either missing or nerfed in size and volume. All trailers are scripted, pre rendered scenes, all the animals have manually composed parts(not randomly like you can see in actual gameplay) and that long-neck animal has its own model saved in the game files, which is not even possible to get ingame.
4 49 Not one of the screenshots is actually from the game. It looks nothing like any of them 
4 36 Yes. I don't have the game but I read that they completely fabricated the trailer. There are no large animals or desert planets, for example.
4 50 Maybe they're 1:100,000,000 like seeing other people.  /s
1 45 I got refunded guys, this is true. Thank you OP.
1 54 How many hours of playtime and what options did you choose on steam support page?
2 5 Nearly 10 hours and got it refunded to my Visa.
4 51 What! I just tried to refund with 6 hours playtime and it got denied.
2 6 Wait what? It didn't go to your steam account?
2 11 No, I got to choose between my Visa or Steam wallet. I think because I bought the game using my Visa.
2 7 You choose where you want it. Your bank account or your Steam wallet. I tried with the Steam Wallet approach and I got declined.
0 26 If this is true, please post source. Not saying it's not real, but I could make that image in less than 5 minutes in Photoshop.
3 52 I have 15 hours and I got declined about 10 days ago. I'm going to try again now.   Also, Steam says this:   >Refunds are typically not issued for purchases that are more than 14 days old, or have significant playtime.
0 48 i throw down the gauntlet
3 50 I think the source is the hundreds of people I've seen saying that it worked. And no joke, while I was typing this I got an email saying mine was accepted after 8 hrs of playtime. Lol
2 55 Seems to be real, i can refund it with 12 hours of playtime. None of the usual indicators come up like Playtime etc. It just went straight to pending.
1 24 You can make that image in 30 seconds with the dev console in Firefox or Chrome and take a screen shot. 
3 50 for anyone wondering how make this code a bookmark in chrome               javascript:(function () {if (document.documentElement.contentEditable === false || document.designMode === "off") {document.body.contentEditable='true';document.designMode='on';void 0;} else if (document.documentElement.contentEditable === true || document.designMode === "on") {document.body.contentEditable='false';document.designMode='off';void 0;}})();
3 39 I can get the screenshot in seconds just refunding the game. 
4 0 I can get it in mere milliseconds by just stealing OPs 
4 27 I can get it
0 37  I can't comment links, so pm if you want the source
4 48 Pm pretty plz
4 30 pm me

3 53 I think the mods did not make that rule to stop stuff like this. Or at least I hope not, wouldn't make a lot of sense.
4 12 Why did the mods make that rule anyway? It has always confounded me.
4 13 Anti brigading.
2 5 SOURCE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Thanks so much man!
0 46 Hey, can you PM the source, I'm 10 hours in and was declined refund
0 47 Done
1 16 PM me too please?
4 1 Let's let this serve as a lesson on preordering. 
4 56 If only. 
1 10 PM please, I have 12 hours and steam refused refund 2 times
2 9 Don't give up steam refused my refunds more than 10 times. but now I got Refunded. Glorious PCMR doesn't disappoint you.
4 27 OK after reading this, I just sent in my 3rd ticket I wrote a wall of text detailing every single feature missing from the game and included fps drops, stuttering and crashes. I just hope it doesn't get automatically declined because of my 16 hours playtime. FINGERS CROSSED.
0 54 pm me
1 5 Done
1 20 PM please.
1 15 What a time to be alive.
1 22 Indieapocalypse brought to you by valve
1 10 Source here too please? 
3 45 Now buy Dark souls 3 from the refunded money and have hours of fun. It's currently on sale and a new DLC is coming up soon.
3 47 Now if only GOG was as understanding...
4 0 Finally the only thing that will actually bother Hello Games and Sean. Monetary losses. He's already become a multi-millionaire off the back of his lies though so I doubt he will shed too many tears. 
4 25 see, it's funny because the entire reason sean started this new company was because he didn't like the way the company he used to work at was going (IIRC it was EA)  yet now his company is being worse then EA, because at least EA will admit that they're going to fuck you with insane prices for something not even worth it
4 45 This was my reply to someone down in the comments. And it's how I feel about the entire industry at this point. I just took a long time typing this out and wanted to share it.  Sorry this is so long:  I have heard a lot of people played the game for 10 hours thinking that the lack of features was just because it was early in the game. They keep playing hoping the game will deliver on what they are promised and it never happens. It sucks, but the fact that you can't return a game that doesn't do what you are promised it does is kind of bullshit.   This is an extreme case and those who gave this company their money deserve to have it returned to them.   Imagine you saw that a car company was releasing a special new car with all of these amazing features, you are able to reserve your car by paying a percentage of the car's price. You get the car and it LOOKS like the car you were promised so you pay the man and take it home. On the way home you notice that certain features don't work the way you thought they would, so you drive the rest of the way home and tell yourself you will check out the manual when you get home.   You get home and open the manual and it's a single leaflet that is basically "Thanks for buying your very own No Man's Car!"  You sit in the car for a while and can't get the sound system to sound right, or at all. The horn only works sometimes and the heating and cooling system is a clunky mess and is hard to figure out. You check the internet and everyone else who bought the same car is having the same kinds of problems.   You decide to bring it back to the dealership, which is pretty far away from your house. So you drive there and when you get there you say "This has none of the things you said it would." and they laugh at you and say "We only allow people to return cars with less than 1 mile on them. Sorry for your luck. Thanks for the money."  Fuck that dealership, they are shit bags. Now imagine the entire industry was like that. And constantly pushed the envelope on how much you can promise vs what they need to deliver on.   The people who made No Man's Sky promised that amazing super car, and delivered a base model Honda Civic. Those who gave it a chance and decided that they had had enough deserve to get their money back.
0 1 Well, They did lie about a lot of features
0 29 Lmao is that real?  Wut
0 57 Can I also get pm'd the source. I'm still skeptical 
1 4 PM Source please
1 7 Source please? Much appreciated
1 12 Pm me please
1 26 Really? I just tried refunding and it said It could not do it cause of my playtime.
2 2 Can you pm me? I have 6 hours and I tried refunding it and it didnt go through  Edit: It actually works! I had over 6 hours on NMS and the refund went through :)
4 31 What did you write the second time? I've been trying to get a refund and it doesn't go through.
2 42 Where does it say this exactly? My refund was rejected due to playtime being over by 2 hours.
2 54 I just tried and it absolutely did not work :(
3 40 Id rather had 39.99 in my steam wallet than own a copy of No Man's Sky. frankly i cant remember last time i felt so disappointed by a game.
4 54 WOW! There's so many people requesting refunds! AMAZING!!!
0 54 I have 31 hours in.. but I would like a refund, the bareness of this game is too much! Send me source good person !
4 24 Sir, could you pass me the link, please? :)
4 5 same i just requested refund
4 20 That's bullshit. At 31 hours in, even if you're disappointed with the final product, you got your money's worth. This is exactly like eating an entire meal and then complaining you didn't like it and wanting it comped. Pure entitlement.
1 54 At 31 hours you paid $2 per hour entertainment... Going to a cinema you'll pay $5 per hour. So I don't really see a reason to refund your game.
2 25 I have 94 hours in GTA V, still counting and it's low compared to most people. For an open world game, you shouldn't get bored after 31 hours/not have an ending to the storyline.
3 15 Well that's mostly because I tried my best to make the game worth the outrageous price it doesn't deserve, by the time most people noticed all the features lacking, it was far past the measly 2 hours . I would even settle for half the refund if I could. Not everyone can afford $70 CAD games . This was supposed to be worth it. But I got denied anyways, so I guess all I can do is leave a negative review like most others and try to save someone some money
4 7 > Not everyone can afford $70 CAD games  Then why did you buy it? What the hell? You decide after you've bought it and played for 31 hours that you can't afford it? Jesus.  You played 31 hours of the game; at this point getting a refund is laughable. This is some serious entitlement.
4 21 Are you dense ? I just stated why I have so many hours. The 70 dollar game statement was also said because due to the false advertising and broken and missing gameplay mechanics, I'd rather spend my money on a triple A game, rather then buy a game full of lies . I bought this game and couldn't afford another game, meaning that, I feel like I wasted my money on this game when I could have bought a game actually worth it's value. I tried to have it worth while, but it wasn't .
4 27 > false advertising and broken and missing gameplay mechanics  And this was discovered a day or two after release. Who put a gun to your head to buy this game at the exact time of release? Why didn't you wait if money is so tight for you? Are you that bad with your finances whereby you can only afford one game and choose a game that's just been released? That is completely your own fault.  You don't get to try a game for 31 hours and get a refund. There are an innumerable amount of reviews, videos, lets plays, whatever else you could possibly want. You decided to buy into the hype and you got punished.  I'd by more sympathetic if you had just a few hours played. But 31 hours? You are owed nothing.
4 35 Bought it at launch. Was my fault , but like many others , didn't realize that everything was missing pretty much, by then my 2 hours was up , tried to make the most of it then left it. When I seen this post I seen hope to return it for a refund . It's a broken game and deserves the backlash it gets and should allow extended refunds since a lot of people could hardly get it to perform.
4 41 > didn't realize that everything was missing pretty much  Wait next time for more in-depth reviews.  > broken game and deserves the backlash  You might be right but this is once again your own fault for not waiting.  > allow extended refunds since a lot of people could hardly get it to perform.  No. You knew very well that Steam's policy was 2 hours. You don't get to extend your own refund. You played over your allotted time and that's the end of it. You took a risk buying a game too early and this is what happens.  > hardly get it to perform  That's what the 2 hours is for; to test if your game works. I will agree with you that if a game suddenly breaks after you get out of/get too a certain area it breaks and they don't patch it quickly that you should get an extended refund, but on the same dime companies deserve a little bit of lee-way to get their games patched out after launch.
4 43 They lifted the 2 hour refund just for this game. So it is a big deal and obviously lots are wanting their money back. Will we get it? No , probably not.
4 40 Maybe one was more fun than the other.
4 33 This is literally the worst argument that I hear parroted all the time.  There are different levels of enjoyment. I have over 3000 hours played on terraria and spent 2.50 on it. No $60 game will ever be as efficient as that. Does that mean I should stop buying $60 games? Does that mean I can't go out to eat because no meal will ever be as efficient?
4 52 If I watch a bad movie I can't get my money back.
4 10 Except he didn't get his entertainment. I spent 20+ hours just looking for the entertainment. Eventually I cheated and got to the center because I thought the entertainment would be there. It wasn't. So we lost money and time now.
4 4 See a reason? It's supposed to be an endless sandbox of imaginable exploration. Of course people are going to play to the end game to feel like they're getting their worth.  at a full priced game, I don't feel he got his worth. The company should have some sort of punishment for baiting people to buy it.
3 59 Well if he refunds the game then he got 31 hours of entertainment for free. 
3 41 That's a moot point.  I mean I hate my job, but I do it anyway, and I don't pay them a cent.  Hell, they pay me.
3 30 This is like people that eat an entire meal but then complain it was cooked wrong and want their money back. 31 hours seems worth $60 to me \_()_/ 
3 51 \\ I think you dropped this.
4 1 *yoink* Thanks  \\_()_/
4 46 Backslashes are often used to escape characters, maybe that's what's happening. Try putting two backslashes.  Edit:  I'm using Relay and I have to put 3.      \_()_/ becomes: \_()_/      \\_()_/ becomes: \\_()_/      \\\_()_/ becomes: \\\_()_/
2 5 At least movies have an ending.
4 46 Too soon.
3 51 And you don't forget the entire plot two weeks later
3 28 Yeah I kinda hope you don't get the refund... That is enough play time to justify the purchase.
3 47 Well considering that this game has been equated as "Like Minecraft in space." And Minecraft being much cheaper and been around having much more to do to justify your purchase. Unlike NMS, which is 60$ and gives you jack shit in comparison to any other 60$ "multiplayer" game. When I seen multiplayer advertised, I expect to atleast be able to put 100 hours into the multiplayer experience to feel I spent my money well. In this game, the multiplayer didn't even happen. 
4 10 What stopped you from waiting a week to see proper reviews of the game? How many times are we going to go through the same thing over and over; stop giving into the hype every single time people.
4 15 I never bought the game lol. And still haven't. It never looked like a game id play anyways. I normally stick to games like Battlefield, Destiny, or Fallout
4 14 I agree to a certain extent, but at some point Hello has to be held accountable for their literal false advertising.
4 38 Do you really need 30 hours + additional information from steam/youtube/twitch/reddit to figure out that the game isn't what you thought it would be?
4 47 No, but that's kind of irrelevant. False advertising is false advertising.
1 4 Sent my man!
4 50 I'd also like the source if possible. :)
3 40 Mind shooting it to me as well?
1 35 May I have the source as well please?
3 26 Can i have the source? this game is horrible :(
2 14 That is bullshit. I just tried to do it earlier today because of the post on r-gaming and I got a decline because of my playtime was over 2 hours.  EDIT: Okay, trying another refund with another reason. I'll report back
1 29 I tried to refund this, care to shoot me a PM?
1 30 Would be cool if you could pm it to me fam, thanks. :) 
1 30 Pm me op 
1 34 I tried to refund mine but they denied me
1 35 What options did you use to try to refund?
1 39 I went to my 'recent products' page and requested the refund there, so it's automated I think?
1 41 But there are a series of options under the steam support section like "The game won't start," "The game crashes," etc. I just want to know the series of options you tried.
1 42 Oh, I did "game is not what shows in videos and screenshots"
1 44 How many hours of playtime?
1 45 25
1 46 Interesting. Maybe if you have over 20 it gets sketchy. I have 15 and I'm going to try once OP PM's me. 
1 36 Can you pm me too?
1 41 PM source pls <3
1 42 Pm me mister OP !
1 45 May you please PM me? Thanks!
3 41 "may you"  lel
1 52 pm? im curious
2 1 sauce would be nice OP
2 5 Yes! Could I see the source? Been waiting to refund this with my 3 hours
2 54 Valve doesn't lose much... the refund goes into people's wallet, they just buy something else usually.
2 56 OP can you PM me the source? 
3 12 I've literally tried to refund this game three times. Help me!
3 14 My request got denied with 8 hours of playtime, so this isn't true in all cases. I've only requested 2 refunds before this, so it's not that I've been abusing the system.
3 16 People could just try it instead of constantly asking for a source..
3 20 Who decides this? Was it Valve or the devs?
3 25 I would think valve, they don't want their customers being upset over something that isnt worth the money in the first place.
3 46 This doesn't sound like something the devs would do.
3 23 Pm the sorcery to me!! Thx man
3 27 Source please. 
3 27 Pm source please
3 28 The last game they did this with that I can recall was Warz. You know you fucked up if they are doing refunds on this scale.
3 35 Can u pm me too, if it doesn't trouble you? 
3 36 Anyone who got pm'd the source could they send it on?
3 36 Source?
3 36 Quick question, would refunding (and removing the game from the library) remove my current cloud data? So if I bought it in the future I could get it again and then proceed to continue where I left off?
3 40 Is anybody else able to get a refund they denied mine
3 44 Source pls
3 45 Noiiiiiiice. Thank you Gaben
3 46 Is this true? I didn't buy it but I have some friends who would REALLY like to refund it but were denied because of their playtime.
3 47 Strange, my refund got rejected because I'd exceeded play time.
3 47 Success, your refund request is now pending.
3 48 Where does it say that?
3 48 Is this true?  How do you request a refund,  have never done it on steam.   Never had to.  
3 49 Prime example of why you never pre-order a game and always wait even just two days
3 49 procedurally generated disappointment
3 49 I am literally dying right now 
3 50 pm me source glorious OP
3 50 PM me sourde pls :)
3 52 If this is real, why is this flaired as satire/joke? I can't tell if this is real from the comments. 
3 53 Just submitted my request, who else did?
3 53 I have requested a refund twice now and been turned down because of playtime. 
3 54 Has anyone that purchased from the NMS website had luck getting a refund? I only bought from there because people recommended it so the devs would get more money.
3 54 Pm me :)
3 55 Woooooow. Who made this decision, Steam or No Man's Sky? I'm not sure how Steam's refund policy works on the backend. It's possible they eat the cost of the game and still give the developer their portion of the sale and they did it for other reasons. I don't know enough, but seriously. No Man's Sky, shame on you for hyping your game and not delivering. 
4 38 Steam may have to eat some of the refund costs from AAA publishers. I *seriously* doubt that's the case with a publisher like Hello Games, they needed Steam/Valve way more than Valve/Steam needed them. It would just be common sense to have some type of contractual protection against being liable for blatant lies from an unproven publisher. The way I would do it is send disbursements to publishers at an agreed upon interval (monthly/30 days/90 days/pick one) and they only get paid for a certain amount of sales that are refunded (e.g. 2% of total sales are allowed to be refunded without penalizing the publisher). Valve gets protection if there are a ton of returns, good publishers don't get punished when games are refunded that really shouldn't be.
4 50 These contracts get real contract, and while they may have contracts for indies and specific deals worked out with Activision and EA and Ubisoft, etc., I'm just curious whether the cost is always pushed along to the developer or (because this steam refund was added relatively recently), they're experimenting and eating the cost they pay to developers because it... encourages more sales and people are more likely to try out a game if they know they can refund it, or the refund rate is so low overall that they can eat the cost as a line item (Steam's a private company, so they don't have any strict fiduciary responsibilities.)  It's likely they payments to publishers are delayed a month or 14 days contingent on clawback/refund rates. I'm just not familiar with how their contracts are in place. 
3 55 Wish they'd adopt that policy with Just Cause 3.  The memory leak issue makes it totally unplayable on my system.  At least No Man's Sky is just crap.  I bet it actually functions at all.
3 56 Is this real ? Cause I'd like to refund it but have too many hours logged 
3 57 I would love a source for this, OP
3 57 Yeah... no they arent
4 0 Can confirm. Played 12 hours and got my money back 
4 24 Post proof.
4 0 Just had my refund request denied. You sure about this OP? Can provide proof if needed.
4 2 This should be sticky on the subreddit so everyone can know. Mods on /r/NoMansSkyTheGame are removing every posts about refunds for the reason `repost`. 
4 2 If this is true, I wonder what prompted Valve to change the refund policy for NMS.
4 4 Ugh I bought mine from a 3rd party site and had it gifted to me. No way to get my money back right?
4 5 I'm glad I saw this post I thought hope was lost for refunding my purchase.
4 10 So being someone who doesnt know too much whats making everyone want a refund?
4 16 Developer said certain things would be in the game but said things ended up *not* being in the game so now everyone's mad at them (instead of enjoying what *is* in the game).
4 56 I remember last time I bought a house. I paid 300k and it was advertised with 4 bedrooms and a garden but when I got the keys it was a studio flat... probably should get over it though and enjoy what's in the flat... decent central heating and a small balcony Yayayayayya
4 18 What like? Things significant or?
4 21 Things like multiplayer.
4 11 So many refunds. Bummer for NMS developer. Hope they learn from this.
4 12 pm me pls
4 13 I requested 2 refunds and was rejected, is this new?
4 14 I'm tempted to buy this game and immediately refund it lol
4 17 It's a good job this was marked as satire, cunts ha ha ha 
4 20 Why does this say joke/satire? Is it not real?
4 21 What? I asked for a refund when I played over 2 hours and they said no!
4 23 Guys guys chill out don't refund the game just wait for the $60 DLC it will be awesome
4 25 Sooooooo where do I go for this refund?
4 25 Can someone please explain why this game is getting all this backlash? Whats wrong with it? 
4 28 It had been hyped as the greatest game of all time. Add on to that that the devs had been downright misleading about what would be in the game, even after they knew what would be in the release version. The final game was mediocre. People weren't happy.
4 25 When I buy it now, can I also play it for more then 2 hours? 
4 27 Wait is this true??! I have around 16 hours, haven't played since a few days after launch though. Tried to refund but they didn't let me.
4 27 I just want it to go on sale so I can buy it.   
4 28 I doubt they will comment, but I would *love* to hear Valve's explanation for why they are making this exception.
4 33 My guess:  Refunds are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Customer support costs money, and a person needs to look at each request. The game may have been receiving such a high number of repeat refund requests that valve figures it's worth it to just refund.
4 28 I didn't get it. What happened to this game? 
4 29 Wait, really? How the hell do I get my money back?!
4 32 good fuck that game and anyone who supports that developer
4 33 Tried it earlier today and they did not accept it...
4 33 Silicon valley in real life
4 34 Purchased through Humble - just submitted a refund request citing this among other reasons. Hoping they're willing to at least give me Humble Wallet in return. Only put a few hours into it on the first Friday out and haven't played again since.
4 34 Really curious how many people will do this
4 34 Is this a joke, or can I actually get a refund now (I preordered and spend around 10 hours getting a 48 slot ship).

4 36 How refund ps4 digital version? Damn it.
4 38 If only they'd let us do the same thing with DayZ.
4 38 I haven't seen anything about the game, is it that bad?
4 39 Wow is this real? Wth? Anyone can buy the game, play 2 weeks and refund? 
4 40 If anyone refunds - go for the game "Factorio", you can get 1 for you and additional copies for your friends :)
4 47 Where does it say? Because that would be awesome.
4 41 Question: Who pays for these refunds?  Steam, Sean, another party?
4 41 Hope this works, my refund was initially declined because I played 4 hours.
4 41 When was this? My requests get turned down
4 41 wow..... props to Steam.
4 42 Only tangentially related but steam are pretty forgiving with their refunds. I played around 6 hours of Pillars of Eternity trying out different classes before deciding it really wasn't for me and mentioned in the refund request that sometimes you need a little for time for a game with 100+ hours of play to work out if you like it and they refunded me no problem. Props to Valve for excellent customer service even when they aren't obliged to help out.
4 45 That's awesome, I never even attempted doing that, though I rarely refund games.
4 44 Well it's just satire/joke right? Not real.  Because if it was real the damn... that's dire.
4 44 Please pay me not to play it   Thanks
4 45 My day has been made. Never again will I preorder. 
4 46 Requested. might need you to pm me i have 23hrs playtime but all with under 60fps and all my planets are gone that i named and uploaded. multiple crash reports and a lot of idle non playtime. about 4 hours of it was idle and just seeing if it was crashing because of something else. it wasn't, crashes at random even if i'm idle. 
4 47 Someone pm me the source please. Thanks :)
4 47 Is 21 hours played too much? 
4 47 Can someone ELI5 for a non gamer?
4 49 My refund keeps getting denied saying i exceed the 2 hour play limit, anyone know over a fix or am I just fucked with auto responses? 
4 50 On the one hand the idea of refunding this and getting Elite Dangerous is quire appealing.  On the other hand, I already have 33 play hours, and kinda enjoyed them. I'll play more, I know it.  And on the third hand I'm poor and 60 is a lot of dough.  :/
4 53 if you want a good space game/sim and don't want to go to Space Citizen take a look at the X-Series, X-TC/AP are still awesome and even Rebirth isn't that big of a mess it was after release
4 50 I have 4 hours and 16 minutes played and they will not give me a refund. I have tried over 5 times now with no luck. At this point, I just want an explanation to why other are getting refunds that have over 10 + hours..
4 50 Sean on suicide watch
4 53 Thank goodness
4 54 So can someone explain to my why this game was such a let down? It seems really fun and like an interesting concept.
4 54 So I can buy it, try it and return it?
4 55 If you own it for longer than 2 weeks  can you still refund it?
4 55 I put my ticket as multiplayer not working, got accepted.
4 56 Fuck yeah.   Got my first request denied because I spent 5 hours giving it the benefit of the doubt trying to fix it.
1 18 Also want source pm please :)   Edit: Also go post this on the no man's sky sub and watch it crumble. Please and thank you.  EDIT 2: Just requested refund for 15 hour playtime, explained my reasoning and will edit again once I get a response.   UPDATE: Attempted to refund and was denied due to playtime. I'm calling total bullshit and those who refunded successfully just got lucky with who reviewed their request.
4 34 Keep requesting, you'll get it
4 50 Just requested again for a different reason and went even deeper into my reasoning this time. I want to see if they will actually push it through and if not then I give up on this whole refund after 2 hours situation.
4 55 Good luck! They're in the process with mine too
2 20 Not sure I condone this or not tbh, getting a refund on something you've gotten plenty of use out of. (if it was truly terrible and you've not a single happy memory of the game then sure)  Next thing you know steam will be offering a pre-order insurance scheme; 100% enjoyment withing 6 months or your money back guarenteed. For one small payment of $2.99.
2 30 still better than losing $100 on the division
3 44 You'd think after buying the $150 Star Wars TOR Collector's Edition I would be more cautious about these things, but I also got fooled by The Division and bought the gold edition.
3 59 I am never buying a Ubisoft game ever again. The division was the most expensive game I've ever bought.
2 53 Just got mine refunded with 12 hours of game time. Just explained in notes how the current gameplay does not match the e3 and interview gameplay.
3 45 I feel like I'm the only one enjoying this game.
4 49 I don't get this odd mentality all of the sudden. People playing several hours of a game and then demanding a refund. I can understand up to 5 hours (depending on the title), but 10+ hours, just seems ludicrous.  I've seen many people mentioning 30+ hours and still demanding a refund. I don't get it.  If you've played so many hours; you've got your entertainment, I'd say.   Even people with 5-10 hours, should have gotten their entertainment, in my opinion.  I get that they didn't deliver on the promised features; but if you've played for so many hours, then there must have been something that caught your attention. Something that kept you playing.  It baffles me, that Steam even considers this, with so many hours played - despite it lacking the promised features. Many people knew this (it was posted pretty much 'everywhere') - even before the PC release (based off of PS4 release) - and if they didn't, they sure as heck found out fairly fast - not 30+ hours later..  It is **insanely** big of Steam, to offer refunds for those people.  ...but I just don't get it - from a consumer standpoint.
4 56 What if those 30 hours are because of the possibility of those missing features, only to find out you've been led on and they do not exist? I tend to agree with your sentiment but can you not see people feeling a bit led on for their money?
2 58 Procedurally generated disappointment.
3 2 My favorite part is the people still in denial and defending this shit game... It's Destiny all over again for consoles
3 41 I don't understand what some people have against Destiny. I've played both, and it's WAY more fun than No Man's Sky.
4 15 Destiny was just halo mixed with borderlands with nothing original to separate Bungie from the Halo franchise. Destiny was just as repetitive and  over hyped as NMS. 
1 25 I love being a PC gamer.
1 52 Is no man's Sky really that bad or is it just hyped as whatever the consumer imagined it to be.  Is the game bad if you're expecting Minecraft in Space?
2 5 Yes in fact I think expecting that makes it worse. The only comparison to minecraft that it has is strip mining. No building of any kind just exploring the millions of random procedurally generated worlds that somehow all feel the same. There's a shoddy, at best, space flight system and little else to do. For 60 bucks, in my opinion, it isn't worth it at all. Maybe for 15-20.   I wasn't on any hype train and didn't really pay attention to it until I played it. I got it as a gift from my brother because I like space stuff. I asked him politely to get his money back. It's just over priced for what is in the game. 
1 59 Can confirm, i played for about 12 hours and i just got my 60 euro back
2 23 What option did you use on the steam support page?
2 47 Not sure as its not in english, but something along the lines of "not the same as the videos / pictures "
2 14 Please post a picture of the email you received from Steam for proof. I'd like to believe you but I've been declined twice now.
4 6 That image says 3 hours and 18 minutes of playtime, but you said you have about 12 hours of playtime. 
2 2 Probably just helping the court, so that less people can get in on the eventual class action.
2 9 Is this legit? Requested a refund despite having 18 hours and they denied me. 
2 12 is this true? i bet people are just buying for the weekend and refunding it
2 30 there is a limit on how many refunds you can do in a week or so. go read the articles on the whole refund feature the devs (and gaben) talked about the abuse.
2 42 I wonder if this is the developer offering the refund or if valve is doing this and taking a hit from the sales for customer service.   At any rate it's really sad that valve had to put in a system for people who made bad decisions. 
4 6 >At any rate it's really sad that valve had to put in a system for people who made bad decisions.  It's part of EU law, and honestly it's not really anything out of the ordinary. There's no reason consumer protection laws shouldn't apply just because the product is digital.  In Aus/NZ I can return anything that doesn't match up to what it was sold to me for, no questions asked. I once had to teach an EB Games manager that, that unfortunately country law trumps his store policy of "No refunds if the box is opened and/or no recipt". I brought a controller told it would work on PC, turns out it didn't, suitable for a refund.
2 44 So, does Steam actively take back the portion paid to Hello Games for the amount of the refund, or is this coming out of Valve's pocket?  I'm grateful for their leniency (speaking as someone who kept their distance from this garbage), but I'm REALLY hoping there's some strong financial backlash against Sean and possibly the team for their deceptive practices, and outright lying about the features.
3 6 So it seems I can now rent this game through steam. Might be worth a shoot
3 13 Yay refund time!
3 21 Thanks OP! Have 8 hours of play time, 16 of the 22 achievements are already done, requested refund due to the major technical issues I've been seeing! 
3 38 No wonder you idiots were duped into buying No Man's Sky considering how easy it is to get you gullible fuckers to believe a photoshopped image and some vague-ass request to PM an OP swimming in your pathetic upvotes...
3 41 When you identify as "a gamer."
3 44 I haven't been following the game hype, but is the game really that bad compared to what was expected?   EDIT: Not expected, but promised
3 47 It is. The overall game can just be described as dull.
3 49 If they fix the game, would you rebuy it/buy it?
3 51 On sale for around 10-$. Sure. It does not warrant the 60$ they want for the game AT ALL.
3 45 WAIT. That means I can buy the game, play it for a bit, then return it for a full refund? 
3 45 Could I complete the game and then refund it? Or does it have to be refunded within two weeks? I think it's disgusting how Hello Games has lied, but I would still like to finish the game.
4 17 look up the ending, save time being disappointed
3 47 But they aren't though, I only have 20 hours in before I discovered that the novelty wears off and it's not that great.  I just submitted one this morning and got an email 20 minutes ago saying I exceeded to 2 hour play time.
4 3 Haven't played the game cause I had no interest in it. Is it really that bad?
4 10 inb4 this is why PC shouldn't get ports
4 21 I'd refund the game and pirate it to save $60 but I'd feel like a dick for doing that because I've enjoyed every single one of the 40 hours I've played the game for.
4 41 can i get a refund even though the game was gifted to me? lol
4 43 I love No Man's Sky.
0 25 I've never seen so much drama over a game. But really, let this be a warning on hype trains and pre-ordering stuff. 
1 21 To be fair, the issue is apparently less that there was an overblown hype train and more that analysis of what was promised about the game even shortly before launch and what was actually delivered reveals that there was some Molyneux-esque lying. 
4 49 arent some of the dropped features even shown in the videos and screens on the store page? thats just blatant lying
2 9 Jesus fucking wept. You bunch of cry baby bitches is exactly what's wrong with this fucking subs. I am pcmr till I die but I am leaving this toxic hate filled sub.
2 34 "Jesus fucking wept" I would like to know what this means please?
2 40 Jesus cried apparently.
3 49 profusely
3 32 Its Jesus Fucking Christ's long lost cousin.
2 24 lol k
1 45  Too bad this is satire
2 11 Can I get a refund even if the game was a gift from a friend? , as I didn't have a valid credit card during the release week I paid him in cash for the game and he just gifted it to me . Thanks 
3 4 gifts can be refunded. You authorise the gifter to request the refund and they process the request.
3 33 I have over 40 hours...  I'm kinda bored now, and I was hoping for more features in the future...  I guess none of that is happening huh?  I really wanted multiplayer, but Sean basically said no to that.  What I'm getting at is; should I refund the game?  
4 9 The question you need to ask yourself that will help you figure out if you should refund after 40 hours:  Am I a cheap piece of shit?
4 23 Yes I am.  :P
4 28 Well there you go then. Hope you get declined!
